    <h3>Frequently Asked Forest Questions</h3>
    <h2>What are your greatest person strengths?</h2>
    <h3>I am a very personable person. I get along with nearly everybody very, very easily. Whether we are friends or not, I am able to get a given task done quickly and efficently with any given person. I have great knowledge about how the band program here works, though I still have much that I hope to have the privilage of learning. I also am musically talented, as I have been playing the tuba for 6 years and have been in honor band 3 of those years. I also have a pseudo leader role in the band already, as a vast majority of the band students respect me and are willing to help.</h3>
    <h2>What are some areas in which the organization could improve and how ouwld you improve them?</h2>
    <h3>Pracice is one of the largest issues in the band program. There is very little practicing going on period; I am no different. What I would hope to get accomplished as section leader would be to have outside of school sectionals each weeks, outside of the scheduled Wednesday ones. Since I wouldn't be able to attend those Wednesdays, I would hope to create a bond within the section and bring practice to the section, as it would be one more pracice for the students. My biggest hope by starting this is not only that my section would improve, but that other sections would follow suite.</h3>
    <h2>What would you want to see more of, and what would you be willing to do to make it happen?</h2>
    <h3>What I would like to see more of is kindness amonst the students so that every student can feel welcome. I have seen many students that have very little desire to be in the band at all, so if there is able to be a greater sense of community, then that would be amazing. What I would do to make this happen is with my band improvement project, which is weekly warm fuzzies. Though warm fuzzies are a special thing, I believe that a constant stream of good for those folks who need it would be highly beneficial. There's a lot of pain in students, as seen with Reagan recently and Hayden last year, there is a need for presense in these students lives. Whether there is just a simple "hello," that could make a student's day who has nobody to talk to. Though this is a controvercial decision, I believe the good would be amazing, as it would require students to talk to those that they haven't before so that they can know if they need help and if they could write them a warm fuzzy.</h3>
    <h2>What did you learn from your conversation about leadership?</h2>
    <h3>I interviewed my coding teacher, Mr. Clawson, to get his perspective on leadership, as he is the leader for our CTSO program. I learned that some very important parts of being a leader is that they should work for the people and for the people alone. They should work on the forefront, showing their people how it should be done. He also said that a leader should be the first to arrive, but the last to eat and the last to leave. These are all incredible points, and all should be observed in leadership.</h3>
