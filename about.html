      <h1>I am very experienced when it comes to leadership and handling crowds of people. I have connections to the real world, as I've held down a job at Einstein's Bagels for about 11 months now.</h1>
      <h2>I also have held a leadership role at West-MEC for nearly the entirety of the year.</h2>
      <h3>This job entiles running the class when my teacher is not present. This includes running the class and keeping them on task, as well as daily tasks such as taking attendance for my teacher. My teacher, Mr. Patrick Clawson, has been incredibly pleased with my abilities and potential as a leader and has continued to encourage me further and further along.</h3>
      <h2>I have tutored five kids outside of school hours over the last three years.</h2>
      <h3>The parents of these kids were all very pleased with my performance, as I was able to help their kids in school significantly. I have personally helped students go from failing to honor roll in a matter of weeks, which both the parents and students are eternally gratful for.</h3>
      <h2>I have helped out with setting up the bandroom over the last 3 years as well.</h2>
      <h3>Whether it was fetching standing or moving chairs or doing everything by myself, I have always tried my best to ensure that the bandroom is always in the state that it needs to be in.</h3>
      <h2>Equipment Crew, though this has not been my strongsuit, I have had my hand in this.</h2>
      <h3>Simply just grabbing the cones or pulling a cart actually brings me joy. I have enjoyed helping out with whatever I could for the last three years. Getting the band where it needs to be by any amount brings me joy. Whether it's just taking the tubas where they need to go or helping to line the field, I have attempted to help in any way possible.</h3>
      <h2>Now there were some questions that needed to be written on a separate sheet on paper </h2>
      <h1>SO</h1>
      <h2>I created a web PAGE to answer all of those questions for you.</h2>
      <h3>You see what I did there?? Page, paper? Yeah?</h3>
      <h2>This <a href="questionaire.html">page</a> is right here for you.</h2>
