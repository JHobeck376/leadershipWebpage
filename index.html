    <h2>This is Jacob Hobeck's Website</h2>
    <h1>I built this entirely from the ground up</h1>
    <h3>Though the contents may not look like much</h3>
    <h2>This is my passion and what I'm learning at West-MEC</h2>
    <h1>West-MEC has entirely changed my worldview</h1>
    <h3>I didn't know anything about how to code</h3>
    <h2>This is very similar to how I didn't know much about band period</h2>
    <h1>Music has always fascinated me</h1>
    <h3>Though I may not be able to always verbalize that to you</h3>
    <h2>Yes, I am very quiet</h2>
    <h1>But my passion for this band the the interests are <em>massive</em></h1>
    <h2>I had a not so great band director in elementary school</h2>
    <h3>He killed my passion for music</h3>
    <h1>But you changed everything</h1>
    <h2>You showed me that there is a great depth to music</h2>
    <h1>That music is art and is so much more than "honk"</h1>
    <h3>I didn't believe that before 2015</h3>
    <h2>This is where I joined your band</h2>
    <h1>Where I joined the band that would change the course of my life</h1>
    <h2>It's impossible to express how amazing the community you've crafted is</h2>
    <h1>Though all I can do is say I love it</h1>
    <h3>This band program</h3>
    <h2>Has given me a family of people that I've loved</h2>
    <h1>Whether it's my best friend Logan</h1>
    <h2>Or my section leader Kyle</h2>
    <h3>Nothing would be possible without you</h3>
    <h1>Thank you Mr. Forest</h1>
    <h2>The experiences and countless friends you've given me</h2>
    <h1>Mean the world and more to me</h1>
    <h3>With all of the lovey dovey aside</h3>
    <h1>Let me tell you a little more about <a href="about.html">myself</a></h1>
